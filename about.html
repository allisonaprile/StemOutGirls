    <center> <h3 id="font" > <p>We all met at FemmeHacks 2018, bonded by our interest in hacking (and doughnuts!). We were all beginners and learned A LOT from the experience.</p>
  <p>Although the event was a huge success, we all knew that there could have been so many more people participating. Thus, we were inspired to begin
  spreading awareness not only about hacking, but to all females of STEM. Especially young women miss opporunties because of lack of encouragement, interest, and communication, as well as the unfortunate stigma surrounding females in STEM. </p>

  <p>Our goal is to connect and inform females interested in pursing STEM, of all ages and abilities. </p>
